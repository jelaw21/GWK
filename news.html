	<h1>UPDATE 1.8.0 - FINAL RANK COMPLETE!</h1>
	<p>RANK 14 IS COMPLETE, you may progress! This update begins switching to currency bills instead of piggies. I would suggest removing all money from piggies and use the currency as when I officially release the pack, the piggies will be no more. This update also adds a bit more stability in the Lab, but you may find some drops have been nerfed. Which makes me think, I wonder if I can use something that increases a mob's drop quantity to get more money. Hrmmm... Keep putting those suggestions in <strong>#server-suggestions</strong>, I do listen and have implemented many of what you all have suggested. Any critical, "I can't progress without a fix" bug in <strong>#server-bugs</strong>.</p>
